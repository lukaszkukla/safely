# Database Disclaimer
Heroku reguralry performs database maintenance. When this happens hostname and credentials change. If upon project submission such error occurs please contact me directly or through the student support department so I can update the link.
Please note this is outside my control. Below is the example of email from Heroku that is sent to user admin when this happens.

*Heroku
Your database DATABASE_URL on app-safely requires maintenance.
During this period, your database will become read-only. Once maintenance has completed, your database credentials and hostname will have changed, but we will update your app's config variables accordingly to reflect the new database connection string.*

*This automated maintenance is a necessary part of our Hobby tier plans, Dev and Basic. Should you need more control over maintenance windows, a production database (Standard tier or higher) offers more control over database maintenance, as we are able to schedule them in advance and provide better tools for self-served maintenance.*

*We expect maintenance to last just a few moments depending on the size of your database. We will notify you when maintenance begins, and again once it's complete.*

# Background
Safely Ltd. is a newly established business in the outskirts of Dublin, Republic of Ireland. It was founded by 2 friends who share common goal of making workplace a safe place. 

Pinky and the Brain have vast experience in health and safety, risk assessment and management. Their previous employers were in need of a simple solution that help them record and keep track of any risks and inicidents that might happen in the workplace. As a project leads in finding such a software they have done extensive research in finding the perfect solution. 

Pinky and Brain decided to join their forces and share their researches with each other. They exchanged information and pros and cons of all tested solutions to speed up their work.

They both came to same conclusion that none of the apps available on the market could satisfy their needs. Many apps required expensive and extensive implementations, often overloaded with features that required hours of training. 

This insight gave them an idea to build their own app. They both work for a global companies that can afford to spend money and build something that will meet their needs. With that in mind both Pinky and Brain sold the idea to the board of directors and got funding to build the app and start a new venture.

## Design Choices

### Fonts

Pinky and Brain have chosen Poppins fonts from Google Fonts library to be used throughout the project.

* Content & Headings - [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins "Poppins")

### Colors

Pinky and Brain have discussed various sets of colours and decided on a set of main colours that they want to be used for the project.

&nbsp;

![Colour Pallet](docs/designs/colour-palette.png)

&nbsp;

The colours will be used as described in the table below

| Hex Value | Root variable name | Text | Button | Background | Opposite Colour
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
| #FFFFFF | white | X | X | X | black, burgundy
| #000000 | black | X | X | X | white, pattens blue
| #E1F2F7 | azure | X | X | X | black, green
| #AE093B | burgundy | X | X | X | white
| #E5BACE | pink | X | X | X| black
| #004208 | green | X | X | X| white, azure

&nbsp;

All of the desired colour combinations have passed the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "WebAIM") and the results can be seen below.

| Foreground | Background | Results
| -- | -- | --
| black | pattens blue | [result](docs/designs/black-azure.png "result")
| black | pink | [result](docs/designs/black-pink.png "result")

| white | green | [result](docs/designs/white-green.png "result")
| black | white | [result](docs/designs/black-white.png "result")

### Images
The only requirement was to ensure that any images used in the app will correspond to the subject of safety, security, work hazards and risks.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navbar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to adapt to various screen sizes. It is **sticky**, it follows user when scrolling the page. Navbar changes depending on the user login status. Upon loading the landing page, unauthenticated have an option to sign in. Authenticated user have additional options depending whether it is an administrator or standard user:

- Unauthenticated user view:

[Mobile](docs/features/unauthenticated-mobile.png "Mobile")

[Desktop](docs/features/unauthenticated-desktop.png "Desktop")


- Authenticated, standard user view:

[Mobile](docs/features/mobile-standard-user.png "Mobile")

[Desktop](docs/features/desktop-standard-user.png "Desktop")

Additionally authenticated user whether admin or not can see number of resolved and unresolved records

![Mobile](docs/features/mobile-un-resolved-records.png "Mobile")

![Desktop](docs/features/desktop-un-resolved-records.png "Desktop")


- Authenticated, administrator view: 

[Truncated](docs/features/mobile-admin-user.png "Mobile")

[Desktop](docs/features/desktop-admin-user.png "Desktop")

### Administrator

Administrator can see list of all recorded hazards for every user. It can also add, update and delete categories, risks and statuses.

[Administrator Dashboard](docs/features/administrator-dashboard.png "Administrator Dashboard")

[Standard User Dashboard](docs/features/standard-user-dashboard.png "Standard User Dashboard")

### Title Truncate

If the title of the hazard record in is too long, the overflow text might be truncatd. In such cases the three dots will appear insted of truncated charcters. In order to see the full title user must click on the specific record to view more details.

- Title overflow hidden: 
![Title Overflow Hidden](docs/features/title-truncated-001.png "Title Overflow Hidden")
- Title fully displayed:
![Title Fully Displayed](docs/features/title-truncated-002.png "Title Fully Displayed")

### Footer

The footer is responsive to adapt to various screen sizes. Each item of the footer is highlighted when user hovers over it. Logo in the footer acts as a home page (back to top). There is also information about the copyright and the designer.

![Footer](docs/features/footer.png "Footer")

### Homepage
The home page is divided into sections:
- Hero Image, with the slogan

![Hero Image](docs/features/hero.png "Hero")

- About the company, a brief description of the company

![About](docs/features/about.png "About")

- Contact form for any enquiries

![Contact](docs/features/contact.png "Contact")

### Hazards List

The hazard list displays all hazards for the currently logged user. Each hazard is displayed in the separate card. User can click into it to view more details. Additionaly, each card can be edited, updated and deleted by the user. Only administrator can view, update and delete hazard records of other users.

[Hazards List](docs/features/hazards-view.png "Hazards List")

### Hazard Details

The hazard details page displays all information about the item recorded by the user. Here user have also option to change the risk level and status of it. Additionally, if the record is missing a descrition, the red text appears indicating that to the user.

[Hazard Details](docs/features/hazard-details.png "Hazard Details")

### Search
User can narrow down the list of hazards using search option. This simple yet very effective funciton will display only items that contain searched keyword in the title.

* [Search Result](docs/features/search-result-view.png "Search Result")
* [Full List](docs/features/full-list-view.png "Full List")

\
&nbsp;

\
&nbsp;

## Future developments

There are a few ideas that I would like to implement in the future:
* Filter funciton to narrow down list based on the hazard type, riks level, status etc.
* Additional user profiles and access levels -> administrator, manager, employee
* Use Google maps location service when adding a new hazard
* Additional dropdown lists of 'Risk Types', 'Risk Probability', 'Risk Consequences'
* Risk level to be computed automatically depending on the 'Risk Type', 'Risk Probability' and 'Risk Consequences'
* Additional field to add 'Corrective Action' for each hazard recorded
* User's can be assigned to specific team within the company
* Hazard can be assigned to specific team to resolve
* Biometric login
* Automated email to notify manager, user or a team that the new hazard has been recoreded for them to resolve
* User profile picture
* Ability to inactivate users without deleting any data they recorded
* Accessing camera to snap an image of hazard right from the application

# Deployment

This project was created using [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub"), [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/ "Gitpod") and the code was written using [Micorsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The project was deployed to Heroku right from the start to anticipate any possible bugs and errors in early stages of the development. I controlled each deploymnet to Heroku and left automatic deployment option off. I used interchangeably two ways to deploy new piece of code to heroku:

* Via Visual Code Terminal
```
heroku login -i
Email: __enter_heroku_account_email__
Password: __enter_heroku_account_password__
heroku git:remote -a __your _heroku_app_name__
git push heroku main
```

* Via Heroku UIElements
```
Login to Heroku dashboard
Choose your own app
Choose 'Deploy' from the top menu bar
Scroll dowon to 'Manual deploy' section
Click 'Deploy Branch' button to deploy
```

## Local Deployment

As Gitpod was the IDE that was used to create the project, the following local deployment steps are specific to Gitpod.


### Cloudinary
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ "Cloudinary")
* Click on the *Sign Up For Free* button
* When the account is created, you should see the *API Environment variable*, we will need this for a later process.


### GitHub
* Visit [Github](https://github.com/ "Github")
* Create an account or log in


#### GitHub Desktop
* Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/lukaszkukla/safely "repository")
* Click on the *Code* button above the file list
* Select *Open with GitHub Desktop*

### Set up your Workspace
When you have your version of the original repository,

* In the terminal run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* In the root directory create a file called **env.py** and add the following content, the content of these, must match the Config Vars in the Heroku deployment section

```py
import os
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = "FROM HEROKU DEPLOYMENT SECTION, DATABASE_URL CONFIG VAR"
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = "FROM HEROKU DEPLOYMENT SECTION SECRET_KEY CONFIG VAR"
os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = "API ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE REMOVE 'CLOUDINARY_URL=' FROM BEGINING"
os.environ['DEVELOP'] = '1'
```

* Add the env.py file to the .gitignore file to ensure that its contents are not made public

* Migrate the database models with the following command in the terminal
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

* Create a superuser and set up the credentials with the following command
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

* Run the application locally with the command
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

* To access the admin page using the superuser details just created, add /admin to the end of the URL.

### Deployment via Heroku
* Visit [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/home "Heroku")
* Create a new account or sign in
* From the dashboard, select **New** and then **Create new app**
* Enter an individual app name into the text box, select a region from the dropdown and then press **Create app**
* A Heroku app has now been created and the **Deploy** tab is opened. 
* Open the *Resources* tab and in the search bar for *Add-ons* type *Postgres*
* Select *Heroku Postgres*, on the popup, ensure the dropdown is set to *Hobby Dev - Free* and then *Submit Order Form*
* Open the *Settings* tab and then click on the *Reveal Config Vars* button and the database_url should be populated.
* Fill out the rest of the config vars with the content of the table below by filling out the *Key* and *Value* and clicking on *Add* for each entry 

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| CLOUDINARY_URL | URL from Cloudinary
| SECRET_KEY | Secret Key generated from [miniwebtool.com](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/ "miniwebtool")


* In the buildpacks section of the settings tab, click on **Add Buildpack**, select **python** and then save changes
* Open the **Deploy** tab
* In the deployment method section, select **GitHub** and confirm the connection.
* Enter the repo name into the text box and click **Search**. When the correct repo appears below, click **Connect**
* Return to the Gitpod workspace and in the root directory create a file called *Procfile*
* In the *Procfile* enter the following line including your project name
```
web: gunicorn YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
```
* Add and commit to GitHub
```
git add .
git commit -m "commit message goes here"
git push
```
* Add your Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in your settings.py file
```py
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
* Return to Heroku
* In the Automatic deploys section, click **Enable Automatic Deploys**. This updates every time GitHub code is pushed
* To complete the process click on the **Deploy Brach** button in the Manual deploy section, this will take a few seconds to complete while Heroku builds the app
* A message will appear informing you that the app was successfully deployed and a **View** button will bring you to the live site
