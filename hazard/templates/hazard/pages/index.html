                Safely Ltd. is a newly established business in the outskirts of Dublin, Republic of Ireland. It was
                founded by 2 friends who share common goal of making workplace a safe place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pinky and Brain have vast experience in health and safety, risk assessment and management. Their
                previous employers were in need of a simple solution that help them record and keep track of any risks
                and inicidents that might happen in the workplace. As a project leads in finding such a software they
                have done extensive research in finding the perfect solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pinky and Brain decided to join their forces and share their researches with each other. They exchanged
                information and pros and cons of all tested solutions to speed up their work.
            </p>
            <p>
                They both came to same conclusion that none of the apps available on the market could satisfy their
                needs. Many apps required expensive and extensive implementations, often overloaded with features that
                required hours of training.
            </p>
            <p>
                This insight gave them an idea to build their own app. They both work for a global companies that can
                afford to spend money and build something that will meet their needs. With that in mind both Pinky and
                Brain sold the idea to the board of directors and got funding to build the app and start a new venture.
